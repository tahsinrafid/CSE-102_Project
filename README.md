# üéÆ Bounce Classic (BUET CSE-24 L1-T1 Term Project)
This is our term project for BUET CSE-24 L1-T1. We tried to recreate the original **BOUNCE CLASSIC** game which was once a very popular game on nokia phone. The game was developed using C language and iGraphics, a simplified graphics library containing drawing, animation and keyboard funtions implemented in OPENGL.

## üïπÔ∏è How to Play

1. **Download** and **extract** the `release.zip` file.
2. Run the executable: `BOUNCE CLASSIC.exe`.
3. Enjoy the game!
